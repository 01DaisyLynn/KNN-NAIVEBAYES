# KNN-NAIVEBAYES

# Description #
 Implement a K-nearest neighbor (kNN) classifier using the train dataset and a Naive Bayes classifier using the spam datasets.When modeling split the data into different parttitions i.e 80 - 20, 70 - 30, 60 - 40 to see which model works and use model optimization methods to improve models

# Main Objective #

 KNN - Determine if passenger survived or didn't survive the accident
 
 NAIVE BAYES - Predict whether mail is spam or not
 
# Setup #

Use different notebooks for each of the classifiers

Load Dataset 

Import neccessary libraries

Review and clean the dataset

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis

Perform Univariate, Bivariate analysis

Create models

# Tools Used #
